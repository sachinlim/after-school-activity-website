# Project Management

The project started off with a few weeks of planning which gave me an idea of the features that I could implement and other aspects of the project I had to learn from scratch. Weekly meetings with my supervisor allowed me to keep on-track and make progress through the weeks.

## Agile Methodology - Jira

As each week went by, every time I would sit and work on the project, it made me better at understanding principles of PHP and SQL, both of which are now valuable to me. The important features were added early on and demonstrated to my supervisor to show how much progress I had made.


After sitting down and thinking of both Jira and GitLab, the tool that was the most valuable to me was Jira due to the nature of it allowing me to set small goals to achieve. I have about 80 tasks, and 16 tasks made by my supervisor in our weekly meetings. 

The 3 years attending uni have allowed me to understand the benefits of Jira and the power of planning and breaking large tasks into smaller ones. There would be days where I got little work done due to me being stuck and realising the solution was to just carefully read over the code to check for errors. 

## GitLab

GitLab was being used as a code repository and mostly contained code from the end of term. Unfortunately, I no longer have access to GitLab account as it was provided by my university, and no longer have the original commit history.
