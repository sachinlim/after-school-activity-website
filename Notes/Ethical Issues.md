# Ethical Issues

With websites, there are a lot of things that can be implemented which can be viewed as unethical. There have been many cases where the big corporations prioritise profits by selling information such as user data or been breaching privacy rights through the invention of street view in Google Maps. With many reports about websites and their issues, it is normal for this project to raise ethical questions.

The users will be seeing and interacting with the website but may not be considering the things that are happening in the background, and many times, explaining what the website does may not be the truth.

## Data

The website contains a database that stores information about the users and after school activities. Even with basic details about users, it is possible to create profiles by seeing what each user is doing, and although the database does not contain full descriptions of a user, they can still be viewed as information that can be sold off to a third party.

An outside source may want to view this information and see how popular certain activities are during the three school terms. This example alone could be an issue, as there is the chance of data being sold off without most of the school knowing what is happening behind the scenes. Parents and even some teachers may want to know exactly what is happening with the data and if the school is being honest when they say information is protected and no outside body will see it.
