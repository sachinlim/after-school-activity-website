# After School Activities Website

While growing up in the UK, I was able to see the different methods that teachers had implemented to handle the activities in the school. In my last school, the teacher that was managing all the activities was manually entering information onto an Excel spreadsheet and making changes as needed. The gathering of information was all done on paper, where another teacher would verbally ask the students what activity they want to do and then write their response down before handing them over.

Websites and online tools are now being used for almost everything that you may have access to physically. The local cake shop will have its own website or the local restaurant allows you to order food directly to your home in under an hour. The process for selecting after school activities may be as simple as asking students what they would like to do. However, you have to wonder how much work is being done after the students' choices have been written down, and this is what this project has managed to achieve.

This project makes use of the facilities available for online applications and tackles the issues some schools may have where applications for after school activities may still be done by hand, requiring many more hours after students have given their choices. A databse built around MySQL has been at the epicentre of this project, allowing me to achieve the vital features that I wanted in order to create a functioning website using mostly HTML, PHP and CSS.

The website will contain a list of clubs and activities that are available for students to choose from, all being stored on the database. All of the students from the school are granted an account that they can log-in with and pick the activities on offer. An administrator will also exist who will oversee and manage the selections to make sure everyone is properly allocated, just like how it is currently done. The teachers that are supervising the activities are able to view the students in their club and have the same experience as before.
